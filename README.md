# Assignment 1

## Files
This assignment consists of the following files:
* plot1.R
* plot2.R
* plot3.R
* plot4.R
* figures/plot1.png
* figures/plot2.png
* figures/plot3.png
* figures/plot4.png

## Assumptions
All the .R files assume that the input file household_power_consumption.txt is present in the same location as the file. 

## Execution
On running the script, the corresponding png file is created (e.g. plot1.R creates plot1.png and so on). All png files are created in a folder called “figures”
